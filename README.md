## Overview

This solution make use of tailwindCSS, vanila Javascript and HTML on the frontend. I created a [web service](https://ipify-x63v.onrender.com) for this project to fetch the necessary data without exposing my personal api key on the frontend.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
